# Card Challenge
### Introduction. 
The following program is a card game where the user can shuffle the deck, and request one card at the time.
When the deck is empty, the user won't be able to get another card, until a shuffle is requested. 

### How to Install
Clone the project in your machine. 
Open Visual Studios Code, and open the terminal in the location of the folder. 
#### Unit Testing
For a quick testing using the test cases, run the following command: dotnet test CardsLibraryTest/CardsLibraryTest.csproj

This will run a total of 10 tests

#### Manual Testing
For running and testing the project manual, please type the following command: cd CardChallenge
then run the following command: dotnet run
This will start the project. The project will ask you to enter a command. I recommend starting with help, to see a list of the possible commands and their descriptions.
